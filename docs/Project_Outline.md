## Work Breakdown

### Initial Data Exploration
Each group member will preform their own data exploration to gain insights on the data before preforming their analysis.

### Bootstrapping Analysis
For this data set, our group will focus on six different factors for our analysis:
 - Income
    - Continuous 
 - Body Mass Index (BMI)
    - Continuous
 - General Health
    - Categorical ranging from 1 to 5
 - High Blood Pressure
    - Binary
 - Any Healthcare
    - Binary
 - High Cholesterol
    - Binary
 
For each bootstrap method, we will look at bootstrapping with $m=[10,30,50,100,250]$ samples and $n=[10,25,75,125,250]$.
Each analysis will explore a specific set of $m$ and $n$ values.

1. Percentile Bootstrap -> McKenna
2. Basic Bootstrap -> McKenna
3. Standard Normal Bootstrap -> Jorie
4. Student t Bootsrap -> Jorie
5. Acclerated Bias-correction Bootstrap (BCa) -> Caedon
